RunPreparation: 2022

Repository meant to store all macros/documents used for run preparation studies. Rules: -- each macro should have a header that clearly states a) what the macro does b) the input needed c) the output d) how to run the macro

**-For modules RateCalc and TriggerStudy are included as a submodule, so make sure they are initialized when cloned**

git submodule init
```

```
